Usage : homedir [directory]

Your homedir is the directory that you will start in when you first log into
the mud and also the directory you will get to when you type cd with no
pathname.  The homedir is different to ~.  ~ is /w/<yourname>/.  It is always
this and cannot be changed.  If you set your homedir to /w/<yourname>/ then
it will act the same as if you were using ~.

Examples:

homedir
homedir /d/FR/daggerford
homedir /std/living
homedir ~
