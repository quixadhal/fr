Usage : chfn

Chfn is the command that lets you change the information that is printed when
someone fingers you.  It prompts you for all the information.  None of it is
compulsory, but the email address is desirable.  If you do not want anyone
other than lords and gods being able to see your email address, just put a
colon before the address, eg :fred@frog.frog.frog.edu
