Syntax : consider <thing>

Consider is the command used to see if the monster you are thinking
about attacking is too high or too low a level for you.  Of course I
know all of you are insane.  But don't complain if the dragon kills you
ok?

Examples:

> consider dragon
You would have to be utterly insane to attack the dragon!
> consider rat
The rat is an easy target.
