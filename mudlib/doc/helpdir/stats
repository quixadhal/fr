Your player character is built upon 6 stats:

Strength     : Your carrying capacity. 
Intelligence : Your ability to cast spells.
Dexterity    : Your ability to avoid attacks and use thiefly skills.
Constitution : Your health and capacity to sustain damage.
Wisdom       : Your ability to cast divine magic like healing.
Charisma     : How witty charming and generally beloved of the Gods. (
 luck)

When you start your stats will be quite low. 8's or so. You can roll for
new stats (see rearrange). However it pays to consider which guild you
want to join before doing this. 
In general 18 in the most important stats for your guild, followed by high
con and as many others as you can get high. Strength < about 12 makes life
difficult due to limited carrying capacity.

Guideline: You should be able to get 3 stats in the 17-18 range and the rest 
            above 14 or so with patience.

At any time during the game you may use the command: rearrange.
