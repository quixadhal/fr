Usage : block <player>
Restricted to players only.

The block command turns off tells and soul commands from
the <player> you specify.
The messages will stay blocked until you either block someone
else or you logout.

Note:  You cannot block immortals nor can immortals block
you, leaving its use to only against players who are annoying
you severely.  Inform an immortal of anyone seriously 
harrassing you immediately by use of the emergency channel.
