Usage : rearrange

This command allows you to rank your abilities in order of preference, 
then allows you to roll for a selection of basic stats.
I.e. a fighter would probably place strength as the top priority,
     a wizard intelligence and a cleric wisdom.
You get to roll a number of times till you get a set of stats that you like,
they can never be "ideal", but a few attempts is probably worth while.

Racial adjustment and adjustments because of guilds will come after your
rearranging.

It will be possible to increase this by completing certain quests and by    
imbibing potions however. Just follow the guidelines at the prompts, and
you'll easily be able to arrange the scores as you please. As this can be done
only ONCE I stress the importance of deciding in advance what your character
shall be like when you finish.
