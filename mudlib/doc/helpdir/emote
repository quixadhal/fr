Usage : emote <text>

The emote command takes the text that you provide and prints it to everyone
in the room.  It is similar to echo except that your name is prepended to
to the text you type. You must complete a small quest in the newbie-area to
get the power to use emote.

Examples:

emote hopes you remember his birthday.....
emote suddenly remembers he has to go home to get some sleep.
