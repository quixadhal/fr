Usage:  finger <name>

This will give you some information on the player or creator you have
fingered.

It returns when they were last on, or since when they have been logged on for
It also returns how long they have been idle for, thier email address
(if they entered it), their birthday what mud they belong to and how old 
their character is.  To change all the information use chfn.  The only
other modifyable stuff you can do is change guilds ;)

The wonderfull .plan can be set in your aliases.  ie to set
alias .plan You are a womble;Have fun

The ;'s in your .plan will be expanded to newlines
