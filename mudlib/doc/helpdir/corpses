Due to the high ambient level of magic generally in the realms
it is a very good idea to bury corpses once you've finished with them.

No, not the smell, they tend to come back as undead otherwise.
Not only are some undead VERY VERY nasty, they are worth very
little in the way of experience. (You got that the first time round.)
So please remember.
Final Realms welcomes tidy killers.
