Syntax : time_limit <number> hours per <day|week>

time_limit will allow you to limit the amount of time the mud allows you
to stay on per day or week, depending upon which you set.  If you know
you mud far too much, this command may be for you.

When you reach your time-limit for the day or week, the mud will quit
you at the next save.  Likewise, if you have exceeded your time-limit,
the mud will not allow you to enter in the first place.

Type 'time_limit' alone to see your current settings.
Type 'time_limit clear' to remove your current settings.

Examples:

  time_limit 5 hours per day
  time_limit 20 hours per week

NOTE:
  for historic reasons, weeks begin at 01:00 on Thursday mornings.
  days begin at 01:00.  Norwegian time, of course.
