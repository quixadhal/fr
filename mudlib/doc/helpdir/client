A client is a program you use instead of telnet that will give several
benefits. They allow you to make triggers that react upon text received
from the mud, make special alias, scroll back in text you're writing,
go back in history to repeat commands and you can use it for automatic
logins at your favourite mud(FR).

Some clients allows you to do shell commands as well while still being
connected.

You can also be connected to several worlds at the same time and switch
between them easily.

-known clients:
                 tinyfugue, tintin(++), cancan, lptalk

Look at your local ftp host that mirror large archives to find the one
you would like to try. If you want to try tinyfugue and you have questions
about it, you could drop me (Manshoon) a mail.

PS:  You need to have a unix account to install a client.
