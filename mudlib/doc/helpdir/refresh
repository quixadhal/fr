Syntax: refresh me
Restricted to immortal use only.

This command is one of the options you have when you have run out of
lives.  It basicly starts you over again.  You keep several things
though.  Any abilities you happened to pick up (like emote or whatever).
It resets all your stats, allows you to rearrange them again, resets
your guild and your skills.  Use this command with care. 
It basically retires your character, but you keep your equipment and
your name.
