"Slice is a Drow Warrior attack based on their skill with bladework. "
  "You get a series of extra blows, the number based "
  "upon your level and dexterity.  The higher level you are, "
  "the better chance you'll have to hit on each blow, and "
  "the more often you'll be able to hit.  As a rough guideline, "
  "at level 10, about 6 rounds per slice, level 20, 4 rounds per "
  "slice, level 30, 1 round between slices.  Before level 10, "
  "the lockout is much higher, but also grows less "
  "a lot quicker.\n";
